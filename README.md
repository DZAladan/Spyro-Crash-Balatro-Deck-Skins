## Special thanks

  ℹ️ This step is optional, but will allow you to keep a vanilla version of the game just in case you may need it.

4. Download the latest .zip file from the Releases;
5. Open it with a software like 7-Zip, then drag and drop the folder inside the %AppData/Balatro/Mods folder.

## To-Do
