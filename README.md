## Special thanks
🟠 [CarrotonMan](https://github.com/CarrotonMan) for the patience and making the files of their [Balatro Dark Mode](https://github.com/CarrotonMan/balatrodarkmode) mod available (I ended up not using them, but still)<br>
🟠 Flowire and SeSebasti for the guides and template files

## Installation
1. Make a copy of the original "balatro.exe" and rename it "balatro_unmodded.exe";<br>
  <sup>ℹ️ This step is optional, but will allow you to keep a vanilla version of the game just in case you may need it.</sup>
2. Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) following the guides below:<br>
  ➡️ [For Windows, Proton and Wine](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#windows--proton--wine)<br>
  ➡️ [For Mac](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector?tab=readme-ov-file#mac)
3. Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/) following [this guide](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/Installing-Steamodded-windows);
4. Download the latest .zip file from the Releases;
5. Open it with a software like 7-Zip, then drag and drop the folder inside the %AppData&/Balatro/Mods folder.

## To-Do
🔲 Find out how the heck localization files work, and implement localization for the textures menu;<br>
  <sup>No, this isn't done yet. The solution I adopted so far is temporary.</sup><br>
🔲 Add support for Dark Mode by making extra skins available when the mod is detected.
